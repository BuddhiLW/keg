This `keg` [Bonzai](https://github.com/rwxrob/bonzai) branch contains all KEG related commands, most of which are exported so they can be composed individually if preferred.

## Install

You can just download from the [releases page](https://github.com/BuddhiLW/keg/releases).

```
curl -L https://github.com/BuddhiLW/keg/releases/latest/download/keg-linux-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/keg
curl -L https://github.com/BuddhiLW/keg/releases/latest/download/keg-darwin-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/keg
curl -L https://github.com/BuddhiLW/keg/releases/latest/download/keg-darwin-arm64 -o ~/.local/bin/keg
curl -L https://github.com/BuddhiLW/keg/releases/latest/download/keg-windows-amd64 -o ~/.local/bin/keg

```

Or with `go`:

```
go install github.com/BuddhiLW/keg/cmd/keg@latest
```

You might want to create a small script to encapsulate `KEG_CURRENT` rather than changing into the directory all the time. Note that aliases and functions do not reliably work from within `vim`, only executables (which is 80% of the reason to use `keg` in the first place).

```shell
#!/bin/bash
KEG_CURRENT=zet keg "$@"
```

Composed

```go
package z

import (
	Z "github.com/rwxrob/bonzai/z"
	"github.com/rwxrob/keg"
)

var Cmd = &Z.Cmd{
	Name:     `z`,
	Commands: []*Z.Cmd{help.Cmd, keg.Cmd},
}
```

## Tab Completion

To activate bash completion just use the `complete -C` option from your
`.bashrc` or command line. There is no messy sourcing required. All the
completion is done by the program itself.

```
complete -C keg keg
```

If you don't have bash or tab completion check use the shortcut
commands instead.

## Embedded Documentation

All documentation (like manual pages) has been embedded into the source
code of the application. See the source or run the program with help to
access it.

## Command Line Usage

```
keg help
```

## Configuration

`map` - map of all local keg ids pointing to their directories (like PATH)

## Variables

`current` - current keg from `map`


## Build and Release Instructions

### Github automated workflow

`.github/workflows/release.yml`: 

``` yaml
name: Release Binaries

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*' # Trigger on version tags, e.g., v1.0.0

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [linux, darwin]
        arch: [amd64, arm64]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: '1.23.2'

      - name: Build binary
        env:
          GOOS: ${{ matrix.os }}
          GOARCH: ${{ matrix.arch }}
        run: |
          mkdir -p dist
          go build -o dist/keg-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.arch }} ./cmd/keg/main.go

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: keg-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.arch }}
          path: dist/keg-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.arch }}

  release:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          path: dist/

      - name: Create GitHub Release
        uses: ncipollo/release-action@v1
        with:
          tag: ${{ github.ref_name }}
          name: Release ${{ github.ref_name }}
          artifacts: dist/*
```

### Using `good`
Building workflow uses the [`good`](https://github.com/rwxrob/good) Go helper tool (often composited into bonzai personal command trees (`z go`):

```
cd cmd/keg
good build
gh release create
gh release upload TAGVER build/*
```
