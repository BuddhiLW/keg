// NodePaths returns a list of node directory paths contained in the
// keg root directory path passed. Paths returns are fully qualified and
// cleaned. Only directories with valid integer node IDs will be
// recognized. Empty slice is returned if kegroot doesn't point to
// directory containing node directories with integer names.
//
// The lowest and highest integer names are returned as well to help
// determine what to name a new directory.
//
// File and directories that do not have an integer name will be
// ignored.
