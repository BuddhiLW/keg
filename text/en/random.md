edit random node, gamify content editing

The {{aka}} command randomizes the selection of a single node and returns the title, id, or directory; or opens the editor on a random node.

One of the core tenets of the Zettelkasten approach is regularly and randomly reviewing the knowledge that is stored in it to bring it to the forefront of your mind so that it can inspire new ideas. Looking at a random content node is one way to accomplish this and break writers block by giving you something random to focus on to get you started.

Defaults to {{cmd "edit"}} if no argument given.
