# KEGML is Markdown with limitations

If you already know any flavor of Markdown then you already know KEGML. Elements have been simplified and given clearer semantic definitions in KEGML and limitations have been added to promote good content that is easy to create, read, search, and maintain. KEGML is 100% compatible with all major Markdown versions including CommonMark, GitHub Flavored Markdown, Myst, Pandoc Markdown, and John Gruber's original. This focus on compatibility means KEGML content can be hosting most anywhere without fear of later compatibility issues or proprietary lock-in.
