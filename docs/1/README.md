# Knowledge management

Knowledge management goes by many names these days:

* Personal knowledge management (PKM)
* Personal knowledge graphs (PKG)
* Zettelkasten
* Mind mapping
* Second brain

The number of books and apps available in this category can be overwhelming. Practically none of them focus on creating content that follows international standards for how that knowledge is structured and exchanged. Most just want to get you to buy them and lock in to their proprietary format.

The one thing these all have in common is getting the thoughts you have captured in a way that brings out more thoughts, and being able to review them later to gain inspiration or simple remember them.
