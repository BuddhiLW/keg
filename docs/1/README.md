# Knowledge management

**Knowledge management** is the process of capturing your thoughts in a way that brings out more thoughts while making them available to review or recall later to gain inspiration or publish and share with others. Knowledge management is more than note taking, but it can certainly be used for it. In fact, one of the most successful knowledge management systems of all time, Luhmann's Zettelkasten, was created in order to capture research and produce publications from it.

Knowledge management goes by many names these days:

* Personal knowledge management (PKM)
* Personal knowledge graphs (PKG)
* Zettelkasten
* Mind mapping
* Second brain
