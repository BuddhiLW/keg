# Collaboration Efforts (20250203012420)

Not everyday can be a "productive" day. 
I try to cherish my personal life; my loved ones; and my health. 
These come before anything else.

Today was like this, play *buraco*, a card game, with my grandfather; see my grandmother...

Everything is fine. Just a day to remember, how good these times are, even though, the world is in endless turmoil.

I played some poker; rode my bike; It was my stepfather's birthday. 

Finally, I talked to Radmir, today. So long I don't see him.

I will try to study some Russian and Chinese, before going to bed. Let's wrap it up.

Tomorrow I have work. And, I plan to also collaborate in open source, with my projects.
