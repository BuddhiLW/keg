# Which license should you use?

Most KEG content will be some form of Creative Commons[^cc] license that requires Attribution. After all, without Attribution people are *encouraged* to openly plagiarize. Getting credit for your thinking is a basic right and expectation for any content creator. Often it is the only remuneration.

For content that is changing frequently, rough around the edges, and something you don't want to go really viral you might want Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs[^byncnd]. Most public/personal knowledge graphs will choose this. This allows copying your content as-is for use by anyone not making money from using it. This is also the best if you want to sell the content yourself in another form.

For content that is really well edited and ready for broad consumption, but that you will never sell in any form, you might want to encourage others to publish and distribute your content on your behalf by giving them full permission to sell copies of your content so long as they don't change anything and give you full attribution. For this you need Attribution-NoDerivs[^bynd].
