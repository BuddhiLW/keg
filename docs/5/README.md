# Let's start a keg

Before going over anything else, why not just make a keg and get a feel for it.

1. Download the `keg` binary
1. Move the binary into your `PATH` and optionally rename it
1. Add tab completion to your `.bashrc`: `complete -C keg keg`
1. Run `keg` or `keg help` to see how help works
1. Decide where you want your keg and `mkdir` to create a directory for it
1. Change into your keg directory and execute `keg init`
1. Update the YAML file to contain your information
1. Exit the editor
1. List what you have created with `keg titles`
1. Create a new sample node with `keg sample`
1. Update and exit the editor
1. Check for the new node with `keg titles`
1. Create another node with `keg create` this time
1. Pick a keyword that is unique from title and `keg WORD` to find it
1. Try `keg latest` to see the latest list
