# Content node

A **content node** (or just "node") is a directory inside a **keg directory** with an integer **node id** for a name that contains:

1. `README.md` file
1. Optional `meta` YAML file with structured data
1. One or more optional content files (including images)

Most nodes will contain at least one **link** or **include** pointing to other nodes and files. This creates a **knowledge graph** structure that can be rendered as a document, static Web site, outline, or mind map. The knowledge graph design is inspired by the original WorldWideWeb and Luhmann's very successful Zettelkasten method.
