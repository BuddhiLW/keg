# KEG specification

The `keg` command aspires to be the first fully compliant implementation of the formal KEG Specification[^spec] which is still under review and development but hopes to have its first major version (2023-01) published by the end of January 2023.

Having a free and public specification promotes compatibility and openness between the apps that are developed to use it, much like the Web attempt in the early days (and failed later to maintain). We want to support this effort with the hope of making an exchange of these kegs just as easy as the Web then. In many ways, KEG is a retro-active movement returning to the things that worked and were lost from the modern Web.
